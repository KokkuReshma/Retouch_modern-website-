# Retouch_modern-website-

This project is a modern rebuild of a photo retouching services website, focusing on responsive design, clean code, and a professional user experience. It's built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Goals

*   Create a fully responsive website that looks great on all devices.
*   Implement a modern, clean design.
*   Write well-structured and maintainable HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   Learn and apply web development best practices.

## Structure

*   `index.html`: Main HTML file.
*   `css/style.css`: Main stylesheet.
*   `js/script.js`: Main JavaScript file for interactivity.
*   `images/`: Folder for all website images.

## Getting Started (Viewing Locally)

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd retouch-rebuild`
3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
    *   **Recommended:** Use a live server extension in VS Code (like "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey) for automatic browser refresh on changes. Right-click `index.html` in VS Code Explorer and select "Open with Live Server".

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Variables)
*   Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

*   [ ] Add actual images for portfolio and services.
*   [ ] Implement a more advanced portfolio gallery (e.g., with filtering or a lightbox).
*   [ ] Integrate a backend or third-party service for the contact form.
*   [ ] Add subtle animations on scroll.
*   [ ] Optimize images and assets for performance.
*   [ ] Enhance accessibility further.
